<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><i>This tutorial assumes you have a decent grasp of the Python language.</i></p>

<b>This tutorial may contain varying amounts of cringe... follow at your own discretion.</b>

<p>C is a compiled low-level language first developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">source</a>).</p>

<p>As a Python programmer, you are accustomed to a language developed by <a href="https://gvanrossum.github.io/">Guido van Rossum</a>. Python was coded in C++, an extension of C (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">source</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, Python is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">Interpreted Language</a>, parsing instructions line by line opposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">Compiled Language</a>.</p>

<p>
    Thus, as previously implied, Python is a high-level programming language (far abstracted from raw machine code) while C is a low-level programming language.
    Furthermore, as a C programmer, you can shouldn't expect high-level features such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented Programming</a> and lists.
</p>

<p>In C, one primarily and fundamentally deals with raw numbers and memory addresses. High-level features such as strings, lists, dictionaries and the like do not exist and must be coded from scratch.</p>

<p>
    To compile C programs you, of course, will need a compiler. For general purpose projects on Windows 11 I'd use <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases">w64devkit</a>.
    w64devkit is packaged with a ton of tools, and it allows one to compile C and C++ programs.
</p>

<p>
    For this tutorial, I'll be using the <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">Tiny C Compiler</a> due to its small size and ease of use.
    I specifically downloaded <i>tcc-0.9.27-win32-bin</i> since I am on Windows 10. Don't stress to much between 32 bit versus 64 bit (unless, of course, you are running a 32 bit operating system).
</p>

<p>Since tcc (Tiny C Compiler) is much simpler than gcc (GNU's C compiler; available w64devkit, mingw, etc), the resulting file size is very tiny. We're talking 2KB versus 240KB just for a simple "Hello World!" program.</p>

<p>(Note: For windows users, I'd recommend adding tcc to PATH. If you do not know what that means, you probably aren't experienced enough in Python to be following this tutorial.)</p>

<hr>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>

<p>A basic "Hello World!" program looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a line-by-line explanation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - <a href="https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/">preprocessor directive</a> functioning similar to an <code>import</code> statement in Python code.
        "std" means standard, "io" means input/output, and ".h" means it is a header file. "stdio.h" contains functions for standard input/output, like <code class="magenta">printf()</code>.
        <b>Preprocessor statements do not end with semicolons.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">int main {</code> - defines the program entry point. Unlike Python, to run any code in C you must define a main function; additionally, this function must return an integer (the <code>int</code>).
        The returned <code>int</code> signals to the operating system the success or failure of your program. 0 = success while 1 = failure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">printf("Hello World!\n");</code> - prints a character array to the console. The "f" in <code>printf()</code> stands for formatted (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10761713/what-is-the-meaning-of-f-in-printf">source</a>).
        Notice also how the line is terminated with a semicolon; this simply tells the compiler this line is finished (unlike the invisible newline [or '\n'] character that Python uses).
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">return 0;</code> - simply returns 0 denoting to the system that the program ran successfully.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="magenta">}</code> - end bracket to define the end of the <code>main()</code> function. Brackets are nested like indentation in Python. Furthermore, C does not rely on indentation at all (a valid program can consist of a single line).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To compile this "Hello World!" program, first create a text file named: "main.c". Unlike Java (and similar languages) the name of the .c source file does not correspond to the name of the <code>main()</code> function. You can name your file whatever you want as long as it ends in ".c".</p>

<p>Using tcc in the console, run <code>tcc main.c</code>. A main.exe (windows) should be generated. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code class="magenta">C:\Users\thbop\Desktop\C-For-Python>tcc main.c

C:\Users\thbop\Desktop\C-For-Python>main
Hello World!

C:\Users\thbop\Desktop\C-For-Python>main.exe
Hello World!

</code></pre>

<p>One benefit, made immediately apparent when using a compiled language, is that users downloading a program do not need a "compiler" (or "interpreter") to run it; their machine already knows how to run it.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Theory Dump: How It Works with cc65</h3>

<p>C Compilers basically convert C code into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a>, assemble it into an object file (".o"), and finally link it into a machine code.</p>

<p>For this theory dump, I'll show the entire process, generating a program that can run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502 Processor</a>, an older and (relatively) simpler processor compared to modern processors. (6502 assembly is also much simpler to understand compared to modern assembly.)</p>

<p>First, you will have to understand the elementary concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">Byte</a>. (Simple explanation: 8 bits, 1 bit is an on or off state.)</p>

<p>For this walk-through, I'll be using this program:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">// We do not #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; because the 6502 is just a processor; there is no defined standard input/output.
unsigned char main() {
    unsigned char i = 0;
    while ( i &lt; 10 ) {
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code class="magenta">unsigned char</code> declares that variable's / function's type as an unsigned (no negative sign, only positive) character (1 byte). You can think of it as an integer variable that can only store values from 0 to 255 (range of 2^8=256).</p>

<p>Aside from that no-so-obvious (for some) note, this program is relatively simple and its Python "equivalent" is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">i = 0
while i &lt; 10:
    i += 1
</code></pre>

<p>The abridged 6502 assembly source file (compiled by <a href="https://cc65.github.io/">cc65</a>) looks like this (with comments added):</p>

<pre><code class="language-asm6502">.segment	"CODE"

	lda     #$00        ; Loads a 0 into the A register; the A register or Accumulator is general purpose single-byte storage in the CPU
	jsr     pusha       ; Pushes A onto the stack (I'll cover the stack later)
	jmp     L0004       ; Jumps to the while loop (the assembly line starting with "L0004:")
L0002:	ldy     #$00    ; This section defines the "i++" expression within the while loop
	ldx     #$00
	clc
	lda     #$01        ; Loads 1 into A so that we can add it to the C variable "i"
	adc     (sp),y      ; Adds A + i
	sta     (sp),y      ; Stores the result in i. After processing this line, the CPU will go to the next line (L0004)
L0004:	ldy     #$00    ; Start of the while loop line
	ldx     #$00
	lda     (sp),y      ; Loads the value of i into A
	cmp     #$0A        ; Compares A to 0A (hex representation of 10)
	jsr     boolult     ; Jumps to the boolult subroutine to handle the "<" sign
	jne     L0002       ; If the comparison is is satisfied (e.g. A is less than 10), jump to L0002
	ldx     #$00        ; When the CPU is on this instruction, the while loop has finished and everything just needs to be cleaned up.
	lda     #$00
	jmp     L0001       ; Jump to L0001
L0001:	jsr     incsp1
	rts                 ; Return from program. This processor can only run one program at a time, so we need to be able to return.
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations! You were reading assembly code!</p>

<p>When assembled, the object file's (".o") raw bytes look something like this:</p>

<p>Now onto the final stage of "compilation," linking.</p>

<p>The linker basically inserts the program bytes from the main.o object file and its dependencies into one executable.</p>

<h3>Basic Data Types and Variables</h3>

<p>This section is going to be very simple compared to the last. So take a breath-- and let's continue.</p>

<p>C has a few common data types:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code class="magenta">int</code> - 16 or 32 bit, or 2 or 4 byte representation of a signed integer. The signed integer can be negative or positive at the expense of a half-reduced max value.</li>
    <li><code class="magenta">short</code> - 16 bit or 2 byte representation of a signed integer.</li>
    <li><code class="magenta">char</code> - 8 bit or 1 byte representation of a signed integer. Commonly used to store a single character or an array/string of characters (more on that later).</li>
    <li><code class="magenta">float</code> - 32 bit or 4 byte representation of a signed floating point number (decimal number).</li>
    <li><code class="magenta">double</code> - 64 bit or 8 byte representation of a signed floating point number. A more precise "float" at the expense of memory and process time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these declarations can be prefixed with <code class="magenta">unsigned</code> to make them unsigned (not negative):</p>

<code class="language-clike">unsigned int a = -10; // Would have undefined behavior (unless you know what you are doing)</code>

<p>They can also be prefixed with <code class="magenta">const</code> to define them as constant and immutable.</p>

<code class="language-clike">const int a = 76; // "a" cannot be modified</code>

<p>
    Additionally, int's can be prefixed with <code class="magenta">long</code> to implicitly define a 32 bit or 4 byte integer.
    On some systems, int's by default are 16 bit while on other systems they are 32 bit. The keyword <code class="magenta">long</code> forces an int to be 32 bit (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13652556/what-happens-when-i-assign-long-int-to-int-in-c">source</a>).
</p>

<code class="language-clike">long int a = -45; // 32 bit int</code>

<p>The <code class="magenta">sizeof(x)</code> function can be used to determine the size (in bytes) of a particular variable.</p>

<p>You might have already run into this issue while playing with numbers: <b class="red">"I can't print them!"</b></p>

<p>Don't worry! <code class="magenta">printf()</code> is defined as:</p>

<code class="language-clike">static inline int printf(const char *__format, ...) { ... }</code>

<p><b class="red">"Thbop, that doesn't help."</b></p>

<p>The arguments for <code class="magenta">printf()</code> are: "<code class="magenta">const char* __format</code>" (a constant character pointer or array; I'll cover pointers and arrays later, but for now you can think of this as a string) and "..."</p>

<p>The word "format" should get you thinking of the Python str.format() method. The concept is the same, but the execution is slightly different:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int a = 10;
float b = 65.0f; // const float values like this must be defined with an "f" on the end
double c = 34.654; // opposed
printf("%d\n", a); // Prints "a" as 10; note %d is the same as %i, I just prefer %d
printf("%d %f %lf\n", a, b, c); // Outputs: 10 65.000000 34.654000
</code></pre>

<p>Some common type specifiers are shown below:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Type</th></tr>
    <tr><td>%d or %i</td><td>int</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%x</td><td>int (hex representation)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%u</td><td>unsigned int</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%lu</td><td>long unsigned int</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%f or %F</td><td>float</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%lf (long float)</td><td>double</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%c</td><td>char (actually prints a character)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>%s</td><td>string (actually a char*)</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>
<h3>Some Basic Operations</h3>

<p>The for-loop in Python has the following structure:</p>
<code class="language-python">for i in iterator:</code>

<p>In C, only the iterator is supplied; one constructs the iterator like so:</p>
<code class="language-clike">for ( varible-definition; condition; runs-every-iteration ) {...}</code>
<p>or, for example:</p>
<code class="language-clike">for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {...}</code>

<p>Miscellaneous note: whitespaces do not affect the code <b>in many instances</b>, so:</p>
<code class="language-clike">for(int i=0;i&lt;10;i++){...}//Hasthesameaffectasabove</code>

<p>Additionally, the variable i will only be defined within the scope between the squiggly brackets {}, so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">for ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {...}
int a = i; // Will result in an error; i is undefined in this scope.
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some other examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int a = 10;
if ( a == 10 || 5 == 5 ) { // || = or
	printf("yes\n");
} else if ( a < 10 && a > 0 ) { // && = and
	// do something
} else printf("hmm");

if ( a == 10 )
	printf("If there's only one statement after if, {} are not required\n");

switch ( a ) {
	case 1: {
		printf("a = %d\n", a);
		break; // case 1 is satisfied, no other cases will be evaluated
	} case 2:
		printf("Brackets also do not have to be used here"); // Note: there is subtle difference between having brackets and not having them
		break;
	default: printf("Neither are satisfied"); break;
}

</code></pre>

<hr>
<h3>Arrays and Pointers</h3>

<p>Arrays and pointers are a source of much frustration for Python programmers because these features are handled more automatically in Python.</p>

<p>For example, in Python you can simply define a list, append, insert, etc to it to your heart's content. In C, it's not that simple. And what's a pointer?</p>

<p>First, let's discuss what an array is. Here's a simple array definition:</p>


<pre><code class="language-clike">int arr[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; // Define array with size of 10
for ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) // "Iterate over the array," more like: "loop 10 times"
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);    // Print the value at index i
</code></pre>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Stack-defined (what we have here) arrays' sizes cannot be modified.</li>
    <li>The size of a stack-defined array must be known at compile time, not runtime.</li>
    <li>Negative indexing (<code class="magenta">arr[-1]</code>) does not exist.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int a = 34;
int arr[a] = {0}; // "a" is a variable known at runtime, not compile time; this code would result in an error
// The {0} would initialize the array's values as 0 if this example was valid 
</code></pre>

<p>To pass an array into a user defined function, the size must be declared in the function parameters:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int array_process( int arr[11] ) { // Notice this array is of size 11; this is still valid but index 10 will result in garbage (random) data
    printf("%d\n", arr[9]); // Print the 10th element
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int arr[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    array_process(arr); // Pass array into function
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What an interesting introduction into pointers! You might have noticed that I've been rather silent on the topic... until now.</p>

<p>The concept to grasp is this: <b class="magenta">arrays are pointers</b>.</p>

<p>Here's a simple pointer declaration (to leave you even more confused):</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int a = 45; // Define a variable; this exists at a particular memory address
int* b = &a; // Define b to point to a; "int*" denotes a pointer variable and "&a" references a (returns its memory address)
printf("%d at %x\n", *b, b); // "*b" dereferences b (returning the value of a); b's actual value is a memory address, so we print that here
</code></pre>

<p>Result: <code>45 at 19ff34</code></p>

<p>Now here's the trick: <b class="magenta">an array is actually a pointer to the first element in an array</b></p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int* arr[4] = {45, 23, 73, 1};

printf("%d ", *arr); // Dereference first value in array, 45
printf("%d\n", *(arr+3)); // Adding 3 to the address will return the 4th element (or index 3), 1
</code></pre>

<p>Result: <code>45 1</code></p>

<p>The benefit is that we can rewrite the <code class="magenta">array_process()</code> function as so:</p>
<code class="language-clike">int array_process( int* arr ) { ... }</code>

<p>The downside to this approach is that there will be no runtime checks when accessing and modifying array members:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">int array_process( int* arr ) {
    printf("%d\n", arr[400]); // Print some random out-of-bound value
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I personally wouldn't reccommend messing with out-of-bounds memory at all because it doesn't really have many legitimate uses.</p>

<p>Now to clear up strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">char* str = "Hello World!";
printf("%s\n", str);
</code></pre>

<hr>
<h3>Functions and Void</h3>

<p>Yes, I haven't properly covered functions yet. Here's some example code to cover them real quick:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">void printintarr( int* arr, int length ) { // A void function returns nothing
    printf("{ ");
    for ( int i = 0; i < length; i++ ) printf("%d, ", arr[i]);
    printf("}\n");
}

int main() { // main() cannot return void, it must always return an int
    int a[] = {1, 5, 3, 7, 3, 7, 2, 5};
    printintarr(a, 8);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Structs and Typedef</h3>

<p>The closest thing to class, structs provide a sleek way to group variables in an "OOP" way.</p>

<p>The principal difference between a struct and a class is that a stuct cannot have its own methods (or functions). You can, of course, create functions that modify a struct, but they must be external to the struct itself.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a simple struct declaration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">struct vec2 { // Declare struct
    float x, y;
};

void printvec2( struct vec2 p ) { // Example of a function that prints the vec2 by passing the struct in directly
    printf("vec2(%f, %f)\n", p.x, p.y);
}

void printvec2ptr( struct vec2* p ) { // Passing a pointer to the struct
    printf("vec2(%f, %f)\n", p->x, p->y); // Notice when dereferencing struct values we use the "->" symbol instead of "."

<p>As a simplification, we can use <code class="magenta">typedef</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">struct vec2 {
    float x, y;

vec2 subtractv2( vec2 p, vec2 q ) {
    return (vec2){ p.x - q.x, p.y - q.y }; // "(vec2)" is a type cast

int main() {
    vec2 p = {5.0f, 20.0f};
    vec2 q = {7.0f, 2.0f};

    printf( "%f\n",
